= Progress report for the DSL book: <em>Business-Friendly DSLs</em>

Published: September 30th, 2022

The MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) of my book on DSLs for Manning Publications has received an update, and is now in version 9.
The main difference from the version before is a name change.
We -- as in: the publisher and I -- have been brooding over the title for some time and wanted something that's a bit less cheasy than "`__DSLs Made Easy__`" for a while.
We arrived at "`__Business-Friendly DSLs__`", which we feel better reflects the content and intent of the book.
It should also cause less confusion about the scope of the book, which focus on DSLs for business-purposes, after all.

I've been working on this book for several years now -- since late 2018 -- and you might be wondering what's taking so long.
This is an especially fair question if you bought it sometime over the last 2 years, and have been watching the projected publication date steadily march into the future.

A lot of the delay can be explained by the work I did for the European Union Digital COVID-19 Certificate -- AKA, the **EU DCC**.
I helped design and implement an EU-wide standard for publishing and exchanging business rules governing fit-for-entry based on the EU DCC, and brought it to production -- all within roughly 2 months.
As you might image, that "`day job`" didn't leave a whole lot of time, energy, and focus for writing, editing, processing reviewers' comments, fixing up images, etc.

As soon as that gig started to ramp down in earnest, my whole family finally got COVID.
We got through that quite unscathed -- thanks to our three vaccinations -- but all this still threw me back a bit.

Another part of the delay has to do with comments received during the last review round.
A number of reviewers were not happy with the amount of "`low-level details`" that aren't specific to (implementing) DSLs but were explained quite in-depth.
An example of this is: how to set up a simple React application using a Web bundler.
We decided to keep this sort of material but move most of it to the appendices.
This way a reader who is "`in the know`" doesn't have to plod through it, and I can just reference the knowledge where needed.

Appendix B explains the minimum of what needs to be explained about "`Webby stuff`" that is not specific to DSLs (or language engineering).
Section 5 of appendix A (§ A.5), which describes the JavaScript idiom used, will also move to appendix B.

I'm also writing a third appendix (Appendix C) which serves as a `TL;DR` of the entire implementation of our example DSL.
This appendix should be useful as a short(-ish), standalone summary of all the ideas, notions, and techniques going into the DSL, illustrated with diagrams and code listings.
This means that people who are already familiar (to whatever extent) with language engineering should be able to use this appendix to "`speedrun`" the book.

I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.

Explaining something succinctly but still clearly understandable is a lot harder than explaining the same thing when you have all the time in the world to do it -- or a fair amount of pages, in my case.
Summarizing most of a book (that's already not very short!) in the span of a 30-ish-page appendix that stands on its own, is much harder than the page count or actual content make it out to be.
The upshot is that I learned to explain the material even better.
The downside of _that_ is that I have to restrain myself in wanting to change/improve the content itself again.
Down that road infinite loops (and delays) and madness lie...

====
Appendix B and C are not in this MEAP update.

My writing and editing productivity has picked up a bit recently, so I'm confident you'll soon see much more progress than you've seen so far in 2022.
We hope to push out the next update with appendices B and C soon, after which we start moving to production.

So, please have a look at the new version in the MEAP.

Some time ago I made a Twitch video on creating a tiny data model DSL editor on the Web from scratch.
Of course, I used and demonstrated a lot of the stuff in the book in the video.
That video has been moved to YouTube: https://youtube.com/watch?v=sxgXj0APVjU
(Yes, the "`cartoon`" version of my mugshot makes it even worse.)

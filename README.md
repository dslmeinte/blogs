## Rationale

I've been writing blogs for a couple of years, on both WordPress and Medium.
Both are OK for writing non-technical blogs, and OK-ish for writing technical blogs with code listings and such.

Having blogs on multiple content outlets/platforms is not ideal.
I also don't like Medium's business model so much these days.
So, I decided to copy all my blogs into a GitHub repository.
That way, I have full control of the content, without relying on the nicety of free(-ish) platforms.
It also makes it easier to include source code, and images, because these are just files in the repository.

The disadvantage is that all existing comments and annotations on the blogs as they exist on WordPress and Medium are not going to be reproduced here.
Technically, I could take the effort, but I don't really see the point so much.
First of all, my blogs don't have that many comments and annotations anyway.
Secondly, reproducing the comments and annotations would mean carrying over the identities of the commenters somehow, and asking for their permissions.

If you're dying to leave a comment, you can either start a [discussion](https://github.com/dslmeinte/blogs/discussions), or an [issue](https://github.com/dslmeinte/blogs/issues) on GitHub, DM me, or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/meinte37).
